# Camera stand with LCD display

The camera stem and back cover is taken from https://www.printables.com/model/38043-raspberry-pi-camera-stand (made in Fusion 3D). You can get the F3D files there if you wish, I just printed the STLs. 

The display-stand replaces original the stand, and was made in FreeeCAD.
